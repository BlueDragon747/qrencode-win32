libqrencode 3.1.1 - QR Code encoding library

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Libqrencode is a library for encoding data in a QR Code symbol, a kind of 2D
symbology that can be scanned by handy terminals such as a mobile phone with
CCD. The capacity of QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000 characters, and has
high robustness.

Libqrencode accepts a string or a list of data chunks then encodes in a QR Code
symbol as a bitmap array. While other QR Code applications generate an image
file, using libqrencode allows applications to render QR Code symbols from raw
bitmap data directly. This library also contains a command-line utility outputs
a QR Code symbol as a PNG image. It will help light-weight CGI programs.


SPECIFICATION
=============
Libqrencode supports QR Code model 2, described in JIS (Japanese Industrial
Standards) X0510:2004 or ISO/IEC 18004. Most of features in the specification
are implemented such as:
- Numeric, alphabet, Japanese kanji (Shift-JIS) or any 8 bit code can be
  embedded
- Optimized encoding of a string
- Structured-append of symbols

Currently the following features are not supported:
- ECI and FNC1 mode
- Micro QR Code
- QR Code model 1 (deprecated)


INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
Some test programs or utility tools uses SDL or PNG, but the library itself
has no dependencies. You can skip compiling those tools if you want not to
install programs using SDL or PNG.

Compile & install
-----------------
Just try

./configure
make
make install

This compiles and installs the library and header file to the appropriate
directories. By default, /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include. You can change
the destination directory by passing some options to the configure script.
Run "./configure --help" to see the list of options.

It also installs a binary "qrencode" to /usr/local/bin. If you want not to
install it, give "--without-tools" option to the configure script.


USAGE
=====
Basic usages of this library are written in the header file (qrencode.h).
You can generate a manual of the library by using Doxygen.


WARNINGS
========
Some functions are THREAD UNSAFE. See qrencode.h for the details.

Carefully use the qrencode command if it is used by a web application (CGI).
For example, giving "-s" option with too large number to qrencode may cause DoS.
You should limit the parameter by your application.
